Essential Questions
How do I interpret user needs and implement them?
I listen to the user's problems and translate them into features. User stories help by framing needs from the user's perspective, ensuring we build what actually provides them value.

How do I approach developing programs?
I use an Agile approach. This means working in small, iterative cycles to build pieces of the program, get feedback, and adapt. I hope to use processes like short sprints and daily stand-ups to stay flexible and efficient.

What does it mean to be a good team member?
It means being reliable, communicating clearly and often, and collaborating respectfully. The goal is to support the team, share knowledge, and focus on our shared success.
